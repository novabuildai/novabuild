    <h2>1. SCOPE OF LICENSE</h2>
    <p>PL8 is licensed, not sold, to you. NovaBuild, Inc. grants you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use PL8 on Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within PL8 as well as upgrades provided by NovaBuild, Inc. that replace or supplement PL8, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a custom agreement. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make PL8 available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute, or sublicense PL8 and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove PL8 before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of PL8, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with PL8).</p>

    <h2>2. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA</h2>
    <p>You agree that NovaBuild, Inc. may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to PL8. NovaBuild, Inc. may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>

    <h2>3. TERMINATION</h2>
    <p>This EULA is effective until terminated by you or NovaBuild, Inc. Your rights under this EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.</p>

    <h2>4. EXTERNAL SERVICES</h2>
    <p>PL8 may enable access to NovaBuild, Inc.’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. NovaBuild, Inc. is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by PL8 or any External Service, including but not limited to nutritional, dietary, or location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by NovaBuild, Inc. or its agents. You will not use External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of NovaBuild, Inc. or any third party. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. NovaBuild, Inc. reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.</p>

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NOVABUILD, INC. OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD PL8 OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE PL8, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF NOVABUILD, INC. HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
